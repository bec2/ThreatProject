# My Threat Model

This application is designed to let home users learn more about the threat environment facing their IoT devices. It allows users to model their environment by selecting devices and risk factors, and then ranks threats according to the level of risks, also giving more details about why each one is a risk and some potential ways it could be mitigated.

This is just a proof-of-concept. The idea is for this application to be used as a starting point, so others can work on making a threat modelling software that is accessible to the average consumer. The information presented in some sections assumes that the user is based within the UK, though the general advice is still applicable to all.

This software is a novel concept as there is a distinct lack of any threat modelling software that is a) intended for the average consumer who is not already an expert in infosec, and b) available at a low cost (free in this case).
